# Semantic-Image-Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326">The 100 Layer Tiramisu paper</a>. 

The data used for this implementation is the <a href="https://github.com/mostafaizz/camvid">Camvid dataset.

I have only trained the model for 2 epochs, but to achieve state of the art results, you can train it more bu doing some finetuning.
